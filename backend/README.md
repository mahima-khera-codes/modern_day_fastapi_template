## Backend tests

To test the backend run:

```console
$ bash ./scripts/test.sh
```

The tests run with Pytest, modify and add tests to `./backend/app/tests/`.

If you use GitHub Actions the tests will run automatically.

### Test running stack

If your stack is already up and you just want to run the tests, you can use:

```bash
docker compose exec backend bash scripts/tests-start.sh
```

That `/app/scripts/tests-start.sh` script just calls `pytest` after making sure that the rest of the stack is running. If you need to pass extra arguments to `pytest`, you can pass them to that command and they will be forwarded.

For example, to stop on first error:

```bash
docker compose exec backend bash scripts/tests-start.sh -x
```

### Test Coverage

When the tests are run, a file `htmlcov/index.html` is generated, you can open it in your browser to see the coverage of the tests.

## Migrations

As during local development your app directory is mounted as a volume inside the container, you can also run the migrations with `alembic` commands inside the container and the migration code will be in your app directory (instead of being only inside the container). So you can add it to your git repository.

Make sure you create a "revision" of your models and that you "upgrade" your database with that revision every time you change them. As this is what will update the tables in your database. Otherwise, your application will have errors.

* Start an interactive session in the backend container:

```console
$ docker compose exec backend bash
```

* Alembic is already configured to import your SQLModel models from `./backend/app/models.py`.

* After changing a model (for example, adding a column), inside the container, create a revision, e.g.:

```console
$ alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add column last_name to User model"
```

* Commit to the git repository the files generated in the alembic directory.

* After creating the revision, run the migration in the database (this is what will actually change the database):

```console
$ alembic upgrade head
```

If you don't want to use migrations at all, uncomment the lines in the file at `./backend/app/core/db.py` that end in:

```python
SQLModel.metadata.create_all(engine)
```

and comment the line in the file `scripts/prestart.sh` that contains:

```console
$ alembic upgrade head
